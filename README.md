# learnify.ly

This was our second project at General Assembly's web development immersive course, and took place in week 8. It was compulsory to use Django as our backend framework. 

The timeframe for this project was 1 week (December 2018).

Learnify.ly is an application that provides thousands of classes to fuel your creativity and career. Browse categories such as Business, Computer Science, Fitness, Music and more to gain skills in what you love. Prices start at as little as $1 per video.
